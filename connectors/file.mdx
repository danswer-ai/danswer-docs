## How it works

The File Connector indexes user uploaded files. - Currently supports `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.md` and `.mdx` files - Can also upload a `.zip` containing these files - If there are other file types in the zip, the other file types are ignored - Optional metadata line that supports links, document owners, and time updated as metadata for Danswer's
retrieval and AI Answer

## Adding Metadata

The metadata line should be placed at the very top of the file and can take one of two formats:

- `#DANSWER_METADATA={"link": "<LINK>"}`
- `<!-- DANSWER_METADATA={"link": "<LINK>"} -->`

Where DANSWER_METADATA= is followed by a json.
The valid json keys are:

- link
- primary_owners
- secondary_owners
- doc_updated_at
- file_display_name

You can also include arbitrary key/value pairs which will be understood as "tags". These tags can then be used in the UI as 
a filter if you want to constrain your search / conversation to only documents with certain tag(s) attached

For example:

```
#DANSWER_METADATA={"link": "https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md", "primary_owners": ["yuhong@danswer.ai", "chris@danswer.ai"], "secondary_owners": ["founders@danswer.ai"], "doc_updated_at": "2023-11-30T13:06:08.589616-08:00", "file_display_name": "Desired File Name!", "tag_of_your_choice": "tag_value"}
```

Full file example:

```
#DANSWER_METADATA={"link": "https://www.danswer.com/captcha", "file_display_name": "Captcha Setup"}

As we can see, there are many web pages or internal tools that aren't directly scrape-able.
In addition to handling local file uploads, the file connector is offered as an option for these tools which may have APIs for accessing the contents.

Alternatively, if you are uploading a `.zip` filled with files, you can define a `.danswer_metadata.json` file and include that in the root of the zip file. 
If your zip file structure looks like: 

```
| file1.txt
| file2.txt
| .danswer_metadata.json
```

then your `.danswer_metadata.json` file might look like:

```json
[
    {
        "filename": "file1.txt", 
        "link": "<LINK_TO_FILE1>", 
        "file_display_name": "<WHAT_YOU_WANT_THE_NAME_OF_FILE1_TO_BE_IN_THE_UI>"},
        "primary_owners": ["<FILE1_OWNER>"],
        // this is an arbitrary tag, can be any key/value pair and can be used in the UI as 
        // a filter if you want to constrain your search / conversation to only documents with
        // this tag attached
        "status": "<SOME_STATUS>"
    },
    {
        "filename": "file2.txt", 
        "link": "<LINK_TO_FILE2>", 
        "file_display_name": "<WHAT_YOU_WANT_THE_NAME_OF_FILE2_TO_BE_IN_THE_UI>"},
        "primary_owners": ["<FILE2_OWNER>"],
        // this is an arbitrary tag, can be any key/value pair and can be used in the UI as 
        // a filter if you want to constrain your search / conversation to only documents with
        // this tag attached
        "status": "<SOME_OTHER_STATUS>"
    }
]
```

## Setting up

### Authorization

    - No external auth flows required.
    - Admins can upload files and make them available to everyone
    - [WIP] Admins or normal users will be able to upload files via personal connectors and make them accessible for just themselves.

### Indexing

    1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **File** Connector.
    2. Select a `.txt` file or a `.zip` file and click
