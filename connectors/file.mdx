## How it works
The File Connector indexes user uploaded files.
    - Currently supports `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.md` and `.mdx` files
    - Can also upload a `.zip` containing these files
        - If there are other file types in the zip, the other file types are ignored
    - Optional metadata line that supports links, document owners, and time updated as metadata for Danswer's
    retrieval and AI Answer

The metadata line can take one of two formats:
- `#DANSWER_METADATA={"link": "<LINK>"}`
- `<!-- DANSWER_METADATA={"link": "<LINK>"} -->`

Where DANSWER_METADATA= is followed by a json.
The valid json keys are:
- link
- primary_owners
- secondary_owners
- doc_updated_at

For example:
```
#DANSWER_METADATA={"link": "https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md", "primary_owners": ["yuhong@danswer.ai", "chris@danswer.ai"], "secondary_owners": ["founders@danswer.ai"], "doc_updated_at": "2023-11-30T13:06:08.589616-08:00"}
```

Full file example:
```
#DANSWER_METADATA={"link": "https://www.danswer.com/captcha"}
How to set up captcha
Follow the example below to set up a captcha

By including a captcha, this page is able to
prevent web scrapers from reading it.

As we can see, there are many web pages or internal tools that aren't directly scrape-able.
In addition to handling local file uploads, the file connector is offered as an option for these tools which may have APIs for accessing the contents.

## Setting up
### Authorization
    - No external auth flows required.
    - Admins can upload files and make them available to everyone
    - [WIP] Admins or normal users will be able to upload files via personal connectors and make them accessible for just themselves.

### Indexing
    1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **File** Connector.
    2. Select a `.txt` file or a `.zip` file and click
