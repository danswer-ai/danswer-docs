## How it works

The Zulip connector pulls in all streams and topics according to the permissions assigned to the bot user.

## Setting up

### Authorization

    1. Onyx interfaces with Zulip as a Zulip Bot which is authenticated using the `zuliprc` config format.
    For more context directly from Zulip, refer to the following docs:
        - https://zulip.com/api/running-bots
        - https://zulip.com/api/configuring-python-bindings
    2. Start by creating a Zulip Bot

    3. Copy the Bot authentication info (`zuliprc` contents), see red arrow below:

    Keep this copied text to provide to Onyx in the next step

### Indexing

    1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **Zulip** Connector
    2. In **Step 1**, paste in the copied `zuliprc` value
    3. Grab your Zulip Realm/URL info, see below:

    4. In **Step 2**, provide the values for the Realm and URL
