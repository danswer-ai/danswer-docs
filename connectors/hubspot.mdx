## How it works

The HubSpot connector pulls in all of the Tickets and their title, content, associated emails and notes.
If other sources of information such as Knowledge Bases, Documents, etc. are desired, this connector can
be extended to support those. Reach out to the Onyx team if you need this.

Tickets are updated every **10** minutes.
