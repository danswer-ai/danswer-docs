description: 'Access files and notes from your Sharepoint Sites'

## How it works
The Sharepoint connector will go through all configured sites belonging to an organization and
index all the documents attached to that site. Note, it currently does not parse the site page
contents, only the attached files.

This includes:
- Word Doc, Excel, PDF, Powerpoints, and all plaintext files like .txt, .mdx, etc.
