## Understanding R2 Structure

Cloudflare R2 organizes data into buckets, similar to Amazon S3. Each bucket can contain an unlimited number of objects (files). You can think of a bucket as a root directory, and the objects as files within that directory.

For more information on R2 structure, visit the [Cloudflare R2 documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/).
