## How it works
The Documen360 connector will pull in all the articles given the workspace and categories that the user specifies.
Articles in Document360 can be saved in either HTML or Markdown format. Currently the implementation only handles
Markdown format. If HTML format is desired, please submit an issue [here](https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/issues)

Articles are updated every **10** minutes.
