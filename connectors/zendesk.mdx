## How it works
The Zendesk Connector syncs all of the published Articles in your company's subdomain.

Some current limitations (a contributor is currently working on extending these):
- It does not pick up Zendesk Tickets
- It does not include comments.
- It pulls all of the articles, does not allow selection by Category etc.


## Setting up
### Authorization
    1. The Zendesk Connector requires 3 things to connect:
       - Subdomain of the tenant (ex. your-company.zendesk.com)
       - Email address of the user to impersonate (owner of the API Token)
       - API Token
    3. See below for instructions on getting the API token

### Indexing
    1. Navigate to the **Admin Dashboard** and select `Add Connector` followed by the Zendesk tile.
    2. Provide the information from the section above
    3. Click connect to start pulling Articles from Zendesk. These are sync-ed every 10 minutes.
