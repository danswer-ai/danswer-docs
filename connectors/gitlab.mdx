## How it works
The GitLab Connector picks up all of the Merge Requests and Issues in a specified repository.
- It will index both Open and Closed MRs. This includes the Title and Summary.
- It will index Issues (and Incidents) including comments both Open and Closed.
- Includes certain other metadata such as the URL, creator, etc.
