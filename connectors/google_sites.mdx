## How it works
Export your Google Site using [Google Takout](https://takeout.google.com/), and then upload the zip to Danswer. 
We'll then index all your pages, and allow you to ask questions based on the site's content!


## Setting up
### Exporting Your Google Site
    1. Follow the guide [here](https://www.steegle.com/google-sites/how-to/export-with-takeout) to export your Google Site.
    Be sure to include ONLY the Google Site in the folder.

### Indexing
    1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **Google Sites** Connector.
    2. Find and enter the base URL of your Google Site. This is the URL used to access the root page of the site.
    3. Upload the Zip file downloaded in **Step 1**.
    4. Click the **Upload** button, and you're done! Your site will be indexed, and will be searchable upon completion.
