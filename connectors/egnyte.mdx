## How it works

The Egnyte connector pulls in files stored in Egnyte. The Egnyte connector indexes the
file name, file type, and contents of the file.

New files are pulled every **10** minutes.


## Setup

### Configure your Egnyte Application + Onyx env variables

<Info>
  This is only necessary if self-hosting Onyx. If using [Onyx Cloud](https://cloud.onyx.app), you can skip
  this step.
</Info>

    1. Create an Egnyte Application. Check out the 
    [Egnyte API documentation](https://developers.egnyte.com/docs/read/introduction) for more information.
    2. Set the following environment variables on your Onyx instance:

```bash
EGNYTE_DOMAIN=something like "app4onyx"
EGNYTE_CLIENT_ID=
EGNYTE_CLIENT_SECRET=
```
    3. Restart your Onyx instance as your normally would to apply the changes.

### Indexing

    1. In the Danswer UI, navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **Egnyte** Connector
    2. Click the `Create New` button to go through the OAuth flow.
    3. Once you've authorized the application, you'll be redirected back to Danswer.
    4. Finish the setup, optionally specifying a folder path to index.
    5. Click `Connect` to begin indexing Egnyte files!
