title: Google Drive Connector Overview
description: 'Access knowledge from your Files'

## How it works
The Google Drive connector ingests your drive documents. It syncs the latest information from 
your Google Drive every 10 minutes.
    - Currently supports Google Docs, Sheets, and PDF files.

## Setting up
Note: This Connector is relatively involved to set up.

- If you want to setup the connector via individual account OAuth, follow the guide [here](/connectors/google_drive/oauth).
This does not require a business Google Workspace.

- If you want to setup the connector via Service Accounts, follow the guide [here](/connectors/google_drive/service_account).
This does require a business Google Workspace / access to the Admin panel. If you are an organization that meets 
these pre-requisites, then this is likely the preferred approach.

- If you have any questions about the setup / which approach is best for you, don't hesitate to reach out
to [founders@onyx.app](mailto:founders@onyx.app) OR `@Yuhong Sun` / `@Chris Weaver` in 
[Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/onyx/shared_invite/zt-2lcmqw703-071hBuZBfNEOGUsLa5PXvQ) if you need help.
