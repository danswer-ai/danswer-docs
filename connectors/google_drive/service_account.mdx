title: Service Account Setup
---

This section walks through setting up the Google Drive connector using a Service Account.
More info on Service Accounts can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview).
A Google Workspace is required.

If you'd rather use an individuals account + OAuth to access Google Drive, checkout the section
[here](/connectors/google_drive/oauth).

### Indexing

    1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **Google Drive** Connector.
    2. Select the Service Account Key JSON that you downloaded in step (3), then click the **Upload** button to save your credentials into Danswer.
    3. Optionally select a user to "impersonate" when fetching files. 
        - If a user email is provided, then Danswer will have access to all documents that user has access to.
        - If no user email is provided, then Danswer will have access to all documents that the Service Account you created 
        in step (3) has access to. By default, this is no documents. You will have to share the relevant drives / shared drives
        with the Service Account so that it can pull documents.
    4. Click the `Connect` button (optionally specifying specific paths that you want to index)! All documents 
    accessible by the account specified in the previous step will now be pulled into Danswer every **10** minutes.
