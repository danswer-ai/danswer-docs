title: Service Account Setup
---

This section walks through setting up the Google Drive connector using a Service Account.
More info on Service Accounts can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-account-overview).
A Google Workspace is required.

If you'd rather use an individuals account + OAuth to access Google Drive, checkout the section
[here](/connectors/google_drive/oauth).

### Indexing

    1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **Google Drive** Connector.
    2. Select the Service Account Key JSON that you downloaded in step (3), then click the **Upload** button to save your credentials into Danswer.
    3. When using a Google Drive Service Account, you must specify the email of the primary admin that you would like the service account to impersonate.
        - Ideally, this account should be an owner/admin of the Google Organization that owns the Google Drive(s) you want to index.
    4. Continue to the next step to select what you would like to index.
