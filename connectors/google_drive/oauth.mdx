title: OAuth Setup
---

This section walks through setting up the Google Drive connector using a OAuth-enabled Google App.
Anyone can do this (even without a paid Google Workspace)!

If you're an organization with a Google Workspace, and you'd rather use a Service Account to access Google Drive, 
checkout the section [here](/connectors/google_drive/service_account). 

### Authorization
    1. Create a **Google Cloud Project**
        - [https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)

    2. Enable the **Google Drive API** and the **Admin SDK API**
        - On the left panel, open **APIs & services**
        - Go to **Enabled APIs and services**
        - On the top click **+ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES**
        - Search for **Google Drive API** and click **ENABLE**
        - Alternatively visit this [link](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=drive.googleapis.com),
        select your project and enable the **Google Drive API**
        - Click on **+ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES** again.
        - Search for **Admin SDK API** and click **ENABLE**
        - Alternatively visit this [link](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=admin.googleapis.com),
        select your project and enable the **Admin SDK API**

    3. Set up the OAuth consent screen
        - Under **APIs & services**, select the **OAuth consent screen** tab
        - If you don't have a **Google Organization** select **External** for **User Type**
        - Call the app Danswer (or whatever you want)
        - For the required emails, use any email of your choice or `founders@danswer.ai`
        if you wish for the Danswer team to help handle issues.
        - Click **SAVE AND CONTINUE**

    4. Set up Scopes
        - Add the scope `.../auth/drive.readonly` for `Google Drive API`
        - Add the scope `.../auth/drive.metadata.readonly` for `Google Drive API`
        - Add the scope `.../auth/admin.directory.user.readonly` for `Admin SDK API`
        - Add the scope `.../auth/admin.directory.group.readonly` for `Admin SDK API`

</div>

    5. Set up Test users
        - This is only applicable for users without a Google Organization.
            - Typically for a company, Danswer would be set up as an internal app so this step would not apply.
        - Add at least one test user email. Only the email accounts added here will be allowed to run the OAuth
        flow to index new documents.
        - Click **SAVE AND CONTINUE**, review the changes and click **BACK TO DASHBOARD**

    6. Create Credentials
        - Go to the **Credentials** tab and select **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS** -> **OAuth client ID**
![GoogleDriveCredential](/images/connectors/google_drive/GoogleDriveCredential.png)
        - Choose **Web application** and give it some name like `DanswerConnector`
        - Add a **Authorized JavaScript origins** for `http://localhost:3000` (or `https://<INTERNAL_DEPLOYMENT_URL>` if you have setup Danswer for production use)
        - Add a **Authorized redirect URIs** for `http://localhost:3000/admin/connectors/google-drive/auth/callback` (or `https://<INTERNAL_DEPLOYMENT_URL>/admin/connectors/google-drive/auth/callback` if you have setup Danswer for production use)

        - Click create and on the right hand side next to **Client secret**, there is an option to download the
        credentials as a JSON. Download the JSON for use in the next step.

### Indexing
    1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **Google Drive** Connector.
    2. Select the credentials JSON from **step 6** above as shown in image below, then click the **Upload** button to save your credentials into Danswer. 
    3. Click on **Authenticate with Google Drive**
        - Completing the OAuth flow will allow Danswer to index the docs that the user has read access to.
    4. Continue to the next step to select what you would like to index.
