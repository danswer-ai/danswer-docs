## How it works
The Web Connector scrapes sites based on a base URL.
    - It only indexes files from the same domain and containing the same base path.
    - It will index pages reachable via hyperlinks from the base URL.
    - The text contents are cleaned up via some heuristics and some metadata such as the page Title is extracted.

## Setting up
### Authorization
    - As long as the page is reachable, no additional authorization is necessary.

### Indexing
    1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **Web** Connector.
    2. Input the base URL to index and click on Index.
