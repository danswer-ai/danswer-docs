## How it works
The Discord connector indexes all channels for all servers(guilds) mentioned.

## Setting up
### Authorization
1. Login to your discord's developer portal https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Create a new application
3. Head over to the `Installation` tab:
    - Check only the `Guild Install` under the Installation contexts.
    - Copy the install link. Easy to just use the `Discord Provided Link`
4. Make sure you have `Manager server` permissions on that guild or server whose channels you want to index
5. In a new tab, open the link copied in step 3. 
6. Authorize the application to the server of your choice.
7. In your developer portal, head over to the `Bot` section.
8. Click on reset token to generate a new one. Copy & save this to use it for when you add your danswer connector


### Indexing
1. Navigate to the Connector Dashboard and select the **Discord** Connector.
2. Enter the **Bot Token** under credentials
3. Enter the server IDs and the channels you want to index. Make sure you add those to which the bot has been authorized

__Note:__ If no channels are added, by default all text channels in the server(s) will be indexed
