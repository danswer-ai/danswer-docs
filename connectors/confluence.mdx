## How it works
The Confluence connector pulls in all pages and comments from the specified spaces/pages every 10 minutes.

## Setting up
### Authorization
    1. Follow the guide described [here](https://docs.searchunify.com/Content/Content-Sources/Atlassian-Jira-Confluence-Authentication-Create-API-Token.htm) to get an access token.

### Indexing
    1. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the **Confluence** Connector
    2. In **Step 1**, provide the **Access Token** and the **Username** (typically an email) it belongs to:

![ConfluenceConnector](/images/connectors/confluence/ConfluenceAuth.png)

    3. In **Step 2**, provide the following information:
       - **Wiki Base URL**: The base URL of your Confluence instance (e.g., https://your-domain.atlassian.net/wiki)
       - **Space**: The Confluence space name to index (e.g., `KB`)
       - **Page ID** (optional): Specific page ID to index - leave empty to index the entire space (e.g., `131368` for a specific page)
       - **Index Recursively**: Check this box to index the specified page and all of its children
       - **Whether you're using Confluence Cloud or Datacenter**: Check the `Is Cloud` box if you are using a Confluence Cloud instance, uncheck for Confluence Server/Data Center

    4. Click the `Connect` button! All the specified spaces/pages and related comments will now be pulled into Danswer every **10** minutes.

Note: If no Page ID is provided, the entire space will be indexed. Here's an example to illustrate:
- Wiki Base URL: "https://example-company.atlassian.net/wiki"
- Space: "KB" (for Knowledge Base)
- Page ID: "164331"

This configuration would index the specific page at https://example-company.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KB/pages/164331/SomePage. If you leave the Page ID empty, it will index the entire KB space.
