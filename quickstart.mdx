---

## Requirements
    - git
    - docker with compose (docker version >= 1.13.0)


## Setup
**This quickstart guide covers setting up Danswer for local execution**

    1. Clone the [Danswer](https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer) repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer.git
    ```

    2. Navigate to **danswer/deployment/docker_compose**
    ```bash
    cd danswer/deployment/docker_compose
    ```

    4. Bring up your docker engine and run:
        - To pull images from DockerHub and run Danswer:
        ```bash
        docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p danswer-stack up -d --pull always --force-recreate
        ```
        - Alternatively, to build the containers from source and start Danswer, run:
         ```bash
        docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p danswer-stack up -d --build --force-recreate
        ```
        - These commands are also used to redeploy if any **.env** variables are updated
        - This may take 15+ minutes depending on your internet speed.
    5. Danswer will now be running on http://localhost:3000.


## OpenAI API Key
**Note:** On the initial visit, Danswer will prompt for an OpenAI API key.
Without this Danswer will be able to provide search functionalities but not direct Question Answering.

You can get an OpenAI API key at:
[https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)


## Indexing Documents
**This quickstart guide will index a publicly accessible website as this requires no additional authorization setup**
    1. Navigate to the top right of Danswer's home screen and select **Admin Panel**
   <Frame caption="Connectors"><img src="/images/quickstart/DanswerConnectors.png" /> </Frame>

    2. In the Web Connector dashboard, pick any base URL to index.
        - This will index all pages under that base URL that is reachable from hyperlinks.
        - You can check the indexing status page to monitor the progress.
    <Frame caption="WebConnector"><img src="/images/quickstart/DanswerWebConnector.png" /> </Frame>

    3. After the pages are indexed, you can now navigate back to the homepage and start asking questions and getting
    answers! ðŸ¥³
