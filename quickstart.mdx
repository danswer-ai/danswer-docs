## Requirements
    - git
    - Docker with compose (docker version >= 1.13.0)
    - System requirements found [here](https://docs.danswer.dev/resourcing)


## Setup
**This quickstart guide covers setting up Danswer for local execution**
<Warning>The most common source of issues is under-resourcing. See section above.</Warning>

    1. Clone the [Danswer](https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer) repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer.git
    ```

    2. Navigate to **danswer/deployment/docker_compose**
    ```bash
    cd danswer/deployment/docker_compose
    ```

    4. Bring up your docker engine and run:
        - To pull images from DockerHub and run Danswer:
        ```bash
        docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p danswer-stack up -d --pull always --force-recreate
        ```
        - Alternatively, to build the containers from source and start Danswer, run:
         ```bash
        docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p danswer-stack up -d --build --force-recreate
        ```
        - These commands are also used to redeploy if any **.env** variables are updated
        - This may take 15+ minutes depending on your internet speed.
    5. Danswer will now be running on http://localhost:3000.


## Gen-AI API Key
**Note:** On the initial visit, Danswer will prompt for an OpenAI API key.

You can get an OpenAI API key at:
[https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

<Info>You can also replace OpenAI with a model provider of your choice, see
[here](https://docs.danswer.dev/gen_ai_configs/overview) for more info</Info>


## Indexing Documents
**This quickstart guide will index a publicly accessible website as this requires no additional authorization setup**
    1. Navigate to the top right of Danswer's home screen and select **Admin Panel**

    2. In the Web Connector dashboard, pick any base URL to index.
        - This will index all pages under that base URL that is reachable from hyperlinks.
        - You can check the indexing status page to monitor the progress.

    answers! ðŸ¥³
