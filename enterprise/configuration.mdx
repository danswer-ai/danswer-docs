## Enterprise environment variables 

In additon to the extra features mentioned in the [overview page](/enterprise/enterprise), you have access to additional configuraton options in the form of environment variables as an enterprise user.


### ENV_SEED_CONFIGURATION

This variable allows you to start your Danswer instance with pre-configured options that persist across restarts.

#### Configuration Options

`ENV_SEED_CONFIGURATION` accepts a JSON string with the following options:

- `llms`: List of LLM configurations (name, provider, api_key, api_base, api_version, custom_config, default_model_name, fast_default_model_name)
- `admin_user_emails`: List of email addresses for automatic admin role assignment
- `seeded_name`: Pre-set name for your Danswer instance
- `seeded_logo_path`: Path to your logo within the `assets` folder

#### Usage Example

```bash
export ENV_SEED_CONFIGURATION='{"admin_user_emails": ["email@gmail.com"], "seeded_name": "Acme Corp", "seeded_logo_path": "assets/logo.png"}'
```

This configuration sets up admin email, instance name, and logo path.

### API_KEY_HASH_ROUNDS

This variable allows you to configure the number of rounds used in the SHA-256 Crypt hashing algorithm for API keys.

- **Default value**: 535000
- **Allowed range**: 1000 to 999999999

#### Usage Example

```bash
export API_KEY_HASH_ROUNDS=600000
```

Increasing this value enhances security but may impact performance. The default value provides a good balance for most use cases.
