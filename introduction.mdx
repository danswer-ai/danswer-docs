## What is Danswer

[Danswer](https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer) is the ChatGPT for teams. Danswer provides a Chat interface and plugs
into any LLM of your choice. Danswer can be deployed anywhere and for any scale - on a laptop, on-premise, or to cloud.
Since you own the deployment, your user data and chats are fully in your own control. Danswer is MIT licensed and
designed to be modular and easily extensible. The system also comes fully ready for production usage with user
authentication, role management (admin/basic users), chat persistence, and a UI for configuring Personas (AI Assistants)
and their Prompts.

Danswer also serves as a Unified Search across all common workplace tools such as Slack, Google Drive, Confluence, etc.
By combining LLMs and team specific knowledge, Danswer becomes a subject matter expert for the team. Imagine ChatGPT if
it had access to your team's unique knowledge! It enables questions such as "A customer wants feature X,
is this already supported?" or "Where's the pull request for feature Y?"

Danswer can also be plugged into existing tools like Slack to get answers and AI chats directly in Slack.
