## What is Onyx

[Onyx](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx) (Formerly Danswer) is the AI Assistant connected to your company's docs, apps, and people.
Onyx provides a Chat interface and plugs into any LLM of your choice. Onyx can be deployed anywhere and for any
scale - on a laptop, on-premise, or to cloud. Since you own the deployment, your user data and chats are fully in your
own control. Onyx is MIT licensed and designed to be modular and easily extensible. The system also comes fully ready
for production usage with user authentication, role management (admin/basic users), chat persistence, and a UI for
configuring Personas (AI Assistants) and their Prompts.

Onyx also serves as a Unified Search across all common workplace tools such as Slack, Google Drive, Confluence, etc.
By combining LLMs and team specific knowledge, Onyx becomes a subject matter expert for the team. It's like ChatGPT if
it had access to your team's unique knowledge! It enables questions such as "A customer wants feature X,
is this already supported?" or "Where's the pull request for feature Y?"

Onyx can also be plugged into existing tools like Slack to get answers and AI chats directly in Slack.
