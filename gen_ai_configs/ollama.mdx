Refer to [Model Configs](https://docs.danswer.dev/gen_ai_configs/overview#model-configs) for how to set the
environment variables for your particular deployment.

**Note**: While we support self hosted LLMs, you will get significantly better responses with a more powerful
model like GPT-4.

## What is Ollama
Ollama provides an easy way to host LLMs locally and to provide a REST API for the model.
Refer to the following resources to get started:
- https://ollama.ai/
- https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama

Once you start a model with a command like `ollama run llama2`, you can verify that the API works with a curl request:
```
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llama2",
  "prompt":"Why is the sky blue?"
}'
```

## Set Danswer to use Ollama
```
GEN_AI_MODEL_PROVIDER=ollama
# Model of your choice
GEN_AI_MODEL_VERSION=llama2
# Wherever Ollama is running
# Hint: To point Docker containers to http://localhost:11434, use host.docker.internal instead of localhost
GEN_AI_API_ENDPOINT=http://host.docker.internal:11434

# Let's also make some changes to accommodate the weaker locally hosted LLM
QA_TIMEOUT=120  # Set a longer timeout, running models on CPU can be slow
DISABLE_LLM_FILTER_EXTRACTION=True
DISABLE_LLM_CHUNK_FILTER=True
# Use only 1 section from the documents and do not require quotes
QA_PROMPT_OVERRIDE=weak
```
