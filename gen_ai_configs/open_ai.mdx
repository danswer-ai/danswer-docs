Refer to [Model Configs](https://docs.danswer.dev/gen_ai_configs/overview#model-configs) for how to set the
environment variables for your particular deployment.

The default Danswer model is GPT-3.5-Turbo so if you wish to use this, there's no need to change anything.

## Set Danswer to use GPT-4
- GEN_AI_MODEL_VERSION=gpt-4
- GEN_AI_API_KEY=&lt;your-gpt4-compatible-key&gt;
    - You can also leave this unset and set it later via the UI

## Set Danswer to use Text-Davinci-003
- GEN_AI_MODEL_VERSION=text-davinci-003
- GEN_AI_API_KEY=&lt;your-openai-key&gt;
    - You can also leave this unset and set it later via the UI
