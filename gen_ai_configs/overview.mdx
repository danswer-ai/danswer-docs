## What are the LLM Options
Danswer supports a large range of LLM hosting services and local/custom such as:

`OpenAI`, `Azure OpenAI`, `HuggingFace`, `Anthropic`, `Replicate`, `AWS Bedrock`, `Cohere`, amongst many others.

For each of these, Danswer supports multiple model options as well, such as gpt-3.5-turbo,
gpt-4, text-davinci-003 for OpenAI and so on.

Danswer also supports local LLMs such as Ollama and GPT4All.

Finally, Danswer supports custom model hosting servers that don't conform to standard APIs. For this option however,
the user is required to implement a small [LLM class](https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/backend/danswer/llm/custom_llm.py#L14)
which can call out to your custom model hosting server.

**Note:** Most of the different LLM support is provided by the [LiteLLM Langchain library](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/litellm)
and are configured accordingly (see the following sections for some examples).


## What are Generative AI (LLM) models used for?
The Large Language Models are used to interpret the contents from the most relevant documents retrieved via Search.
These models extract out the useful knowledge from your documents and generates the **AI Answer**.


## What is the default LLM?
By default, Danswer uses `GPT-3.5-Turbo` from OpenAI. This is the most accessible model/hosting service since it does
not require any access approval process like `GPT-4` or `Llama2` variants.
OpenAI also hosts the models behind an API which makes it easy to use and much more cost efficient than hosting a model
yourself on dedicated hardware.


## Why would you want to use a different model
- Use a more powerful model despite higher cost (such as GPT-4)
- Use a hosting service with a different data retention policy
    - Currently OpenAI and Azure OpenAI retain data for 30 days for monitoring against misuse
- Host the model yourself for complete control and flexibility
    - The Gen AI is the only feature in Danswer that reaches out to third party controlled service
    - There are options (see below) to avoid this entirely but at the cost of performance
- Use a different model perhaps finetuned or better suited for a particular domain of interest


## Danswer Model configs
All Danswer Gen AI configs are done through deployment environment variables. For `docker compose` this means
overwriting the default values in the .env file during deployment. For `kubernetes` this means updating the service
deployment yaml files (specifically, the api_server and background services).

The environment variables that impact the Gen AI models are as follows:
- **GEN_AI_MODEL_PROVIDER**: Use a LiteLLM compatible model service (ie. openai, azure, huggingface, gpt4all, etc),
    - Specify "custom" to use a [custom implementation](https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/backend/danswer/llm/custom_llm.py#L14).
- **GEN_AI_MODEL_VERSION**: Which model version to use, such as `gpt-4`, `Falcon-180B-Chat-GPTQ`, etc.
    - _Be sure to use a version compatible with the hosting service_
- **GEN_AI_API_KEY**: Provide this if your LLM services requires an API key (it probably does).
- **GEN_AI_API_ENDPOINT**: API endpoint, such as `https://danswer.openai.azure.com/` for Azure OpenAI.
- **GEN_AI_API_VERSION**: API version for Azure OpenAI, such as "2023-09-15-preview"
- **GEN_AI_LLM_PROVIDER_TYPE**: Set if using a model server that follows a standard LLM API.
For an OpenAI compatible model server like fastChat, set to "openai".

See the next sections for some examples on how to configure different options.

As always, don't hesitate to reach out to the [Danswer team](https://docs.danswer.dev/contact_us) if you have any
questions or issues.
