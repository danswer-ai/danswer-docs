Refer to [Model Configs](https://docs.danswer.dev/gen_ai_configs/overview#model-configs) for how to set the
environment variables for your particular deployment.

If you're already familiar with Azure OpenAI, feel free to skip to the
[configuring Danswer](https://docs.danswer.dev/gen_ai_configs/azure#configuring-danswer-to-use-azure-openai-endpoint)
section at the end

## Why use Azure OpenAI
By far the most requested model integration has been Azure OpenAI. As of Aug 2023, GPT-4 is the most capable LLM
available. When combined with the Enterprise grade security and geographical deployment options of Azure, this
becomes a very attractive option for using with Danswer.

## Set up Azure OpenAI Endpoint
As of Aug 2023, Azure OpenAI access is by
[application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/limited-access) only. This may change
moving forward, please check online for the latest information.

Start by creating the Azure OpenAI Resource
- Search for `Azure OpenAI` service
- Click on **+Create** to create a new Azure OpenAI resource

Once the resource is created, visit it in **Azure OpenAI Studio**
Select **Chat**
