## Common Environment Variables

All of the global configuration options that are not built into the UI are set via environment variables.
This page contains an exhaustive list of all the options.

There are defaults set in the code so changing/settings these values is **not required** to use Onyx.
A few notable settings that are more frequently changed however are the following:

- AUTH_TYPE (default value is `disabled`)
- MULTILINGUAL_QUERY_EXPANSION (you can provide a comma separated list of languages for query rephrasing such as `English,French`)
- LOG_LEVEL (default is `info`)
- WEB_DOMAIN (your full url in production, including the protocol- e.g. `https://www.onyx.app`)

## Docker Compose

There are several ways to configure environment variables for the containers. For Docker Compose, there are many ways
to pass environment variables to the container, any of the standard approaches will work. However
**the preferred approach** for Onyx is to use the `.env` file. To do this, create a file called `.env` at
`onyx/deployment/docker_compose/.env`. From there, populate it with the values you want to override:

```
# Configures basic email/password based login
AUTH_TYPE="basic"

# Rephrasing the query into different languages to improve search recall
MULTILINGUAL_QUERY_EXPANSION="English,Spanish,German"

# Set a cheaper/faster LLM for the flows that are easier (such as translating the query etc.)
FAST_GEN_AI_MODEL_VERSION="gpt-3.5-turbo"

# Setting more verbose logging
LOG_LEVEL="debug"
LOG_ALL_MODEL_INTERACTIONS="true"
```

## Kubernetes

For Kubernetes, the deployment yaml files includes an Environment ConfigMap. Simply update the values in the file
[here](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/blob/main/deployment/kubernetes/env-configmap.yaml).

## All Environment Variables

This is an extensive list of the currently supported environment variables within Onyx. There are several classes of environment variables. All of the global configuration options that are not built into the UI are set via environment variables.

You can set these in your `.env` file.

### Auth Settings

#### NEXT_PUBLIC_FORGOT_PASSWORD_ENABLED

Set to `true` to enable the forgot password feature. Only enable this if you have configured the above SMTP settings (For email functionality).

### Gen AI Settings

These variables configure the generative AI capabilities of Onyx. These are covered in more depth at the [generative AI configs](/gen_ai_configs/overview).

#### GEN_AI_MODEL_PROVIDER

Specifies the provider of the generative AI model (e.g., `openai`, `anthropic`, `huggingface`).

#### GEN_AI_API_KEY

API key for accessing the generative AI service. Keep this value secret.

#### GEN_AI_LLM_PROVIDER_TYPE

### Query Options

These variables control various aspects of query processing and search behavior.

#### DOC_TIME_DECAY
