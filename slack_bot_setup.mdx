## How it works

Danswer will connect to your Slack instance via Web Sockets, and listen for relevant messages. 

Slack will only send us messages for channels where DanswerBot has been manually added to. For all
channel messages (not messages inside a thread), Danswer will consider the question, search through
all available documents, and try to come up with an answer. If it finds an answer, it will respond to
the message in the **thread** as follows:

Since we are using Web Sockets, Danswer is able to initiate the connection. This means that this is able
to work even if you are running Danswer inside a firewall protected VPC.

## Setting up

### Authorization

**Note:** You must be an admin of the Slack workspace to set up the Slack bot.

1. Navigate and sign in to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps).
2. Create a new Slack app:
   - Click the **Create New App** button in the top right.
   - Select **From an app manifest** option.
   - Select the relevant workspace from the dropdown and click **Next**.

3. Copy the following manifest into the text box

```
display_information:
  name: DanswerBot
  description: I help answer questions!
features:
  bot_user:
    display_name: DanswerBot
    always_online: true
  slash_commands:
    - command: /danswer
      description: Get back a private answer!
      usage_hint: put your question here!
      should_escape: false
oauth_config:
  scopes:
    bot:
      - channels:history
      - channels:read
      - groups:read
      - groups:history
      - channels:join
      - app_mentions:read
      - chat:write
      - reactions:write
      - commands
settings:
  event_subscriptions:
    bot_events:
      - app_mention
      - message.channels
      - message.groups
  interactivity:
    is_enabled: true
  org_deploy_enabled: false
  socket_mode_enabled: true
  token_rotation_enabled: false
```

5. Click the **Create** button.
6. Generate an `App-level Token`, following the guide [here](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/socket#token).
Add the `connections:write` scope to the app-level token and click **Generate**.
Copy this somewhere safe for now, as you will need this later to initiate the Web Socket-based connection to Slack.
7. In the app page, navigate to the **OAuth & Permissions** tab under the **Features** header.
8. Under **OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace**, select `Install to Workspace` and Allow the app.

9. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token**, this will be needed later to enable us to respond to messages as DanswerBot.

### Setting Env variables

**Note:** Currently, Slack bot setup is only suppported out of the box for the docker compose based deployment.
Please contact us if you are deploying Danswer in some other way, we'd be happy to help you set up the Slack bot!

1. [OPTIONAL] SSH into the box where you are hosting Danswer. If running locally, ignore this step.
2. Navigate to `danswer/deployment/docker_compose.
3. Open up the `.env` file using your favorite editor and add the following two lines:
```
DANSWER_BOT_SLACK_APP_TOKEN=<APP_TOKEN_HERE>
DANSWER_BOT_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=<BOT_TOKEN_HERE>
```
4. Restart the background service with one of the following: 
```
# if running locally
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p danswer-stack up background -d --force-recreate

# if running on a machine in the cloud for production use
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml -p danswer-stack up background -d --build --force-recreate
```
5. Wait a few minutes for the background component to restart, and voila you're done! 
You should be able to add DanswerBot to a channel of your choosing, 
ask a question, and get a response!
