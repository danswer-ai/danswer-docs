## OnyxBot Introduction

Onyx will connect to your Slack and listen for messages to answer.

You can easily configure rules for what channels Onyx should respond in, what knowledge sets should back each
configured channel, and set filters to respond or not respond to different types of messages.

When Onyx identifies valid questions, it will respond in the message thread with:

- An LLM generated answer
- Quotes of the most relevant excerpts
- Sources with highlighted keywords

Onyx also provides a configuration page so you can create custom settings for each slack channel
(or you can just use the default settings for all your channels).

Since we are using Web Sockets, Onyx is able to initiate the connection. This means that this is able
to work even if you are running Onyx inside a firewall protected VPC.

## Setting up

### Authorization

**Note:** You must be an admin of the Slack workspace to set up the Slack bot.

1. Navigate and sign in to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps).
2. Create a new Slack app:
   - Click the **Create New App** button in the top right.
   - Select **From an app manifest** option.
   - Select the relevant workspace from the dropdown and click **Next**.

3. Select the "YAML" tab, paste the following manifest into the text box, and click **Next**:

```

    home_tab_enabled: false

      - commands
      - groups:history
      - groups:read
      - im:history
      - im:read
      - mpim:history
      - reactions:write
      - users:read.email
      - users:read
settings:

    bot_events:
      - app_mention
      - message.channels

      - message.mpim
  interactivity:
    is_enabled: true
  org_deploy_enabled: false
  socket_mode_enabled: true
  token_rotation_enabled: false
```

5. Click the **Create** button.
6. Generate an `App-level Token`; Under **Basic Information**, scroll to the **App-level tokens** section and click the button to generate an **App-level token**. ([learn more](https://api.slack.com/apis/connections/socket#token))
   <br />
   Add the `connections:write` scope to the app-level token and click **Generate**.
   Copy this somewhere safe for now, as you will need this later to initiate the
   Web Socket-based connection to Slack.
7. In the app page, navigate to the **OAuth & Permissions** tab under the **Features** header.
8. Under **OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace**, select `Install to Workspace` and Allow the app.

9. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token**, this will be needed later to enable us to respond to messages as OnyxBot.

### Setting Onyx to use it

Start by finding the admin page in the top right of the Onyx web UI.
![OnyxAdminButton](/images/slack_bot/OnyxAdminButton.png)

On the left hand menu of the admin page, navigate to the bottom to **Bots**.

Provide your Slack Tokens and Onyx will start to respond to your slack channels after a short startup delay.

There are also a set of less often used / more advanced configuration options available via environment
variables that can set things like how many "Reference Documents" to show per answer, etc.
Refer to the available configs
