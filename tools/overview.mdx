**Tools** are a way to give an Assistant additional capabilities. They allow the assistant to do things like:

1. Fetch information from an external source (e.g. a database, an API, the Internet, etc.)
2. Perform actions (e.g. write to a database, send an email, etc.)
3. Generate content (e.g. generate an Image, create a plot, etc.)

By default, we have a three tools built-in to Onyx. These are:

- `SearchTool`. This is the core of Onyx. Adding this tool to an Assistant allows
  it to search over the knowledge you've connected up to Onyx through `Connectors`.
  This is the only tool available to the default `Onyx` assistant.

- `ImageGenerationTool`. This leverages DALLE-3 to generate images.

- `InternetSearchTool`. This uses Bing to search the internet. To enable this as an option, set the `BING_API_KEY` environment variable.
