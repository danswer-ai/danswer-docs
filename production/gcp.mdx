You can use GCP Google Compute Engines (VM Instance) to deploy Onyx. The steps are very similar to deploying on AWS EC2.
Before we get started, make sure you have an account with Google Cloud Platform and have the necessary permissions to create a VM instance.
Feel free to reach out to us via the links on our [Contact Us](https://docs.onyx.app/contact_us) page for more individual help.

## Getting an Instance

Steps to create a VM instance from Google Cloud Console:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to create a VM Instance ![Create VM INstance](/images/setup_guides/gcp/CreateVmInstance.png)
2. Select an existing project or create a new one under your organization.
3. We recommend at least 16GB of RAM, 4-8vCPU cores, and 500GB of disk. The exact instance type to
   choose depends on your document volume and query load, but a `e2-standard-4`/`e2-standard-8` is a
   good starting point. For more details on GCP instances, you can refer to
   the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances).
   For more information on sizing, refer to our [resourcing guide](https://docs.onyx.app/resourcing).

4. Make sure to allow HTTPS traffic in the firewall settings and valid scopes for the instance. ![Firewall](/images/setup_guides/gcp/Firewall.png)

For the below guide, we will assume that you’ve chosen to use GCP Debian GNU/Linux machine with the recommended `e2-standard-4` instance.
For more details, you can follow the steps in the [GCP documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart) to create a [VM instance](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-start-instance).

## Pointing your Domain to the Instance

Next, we should point your domain to the VM instance we just created. To do this, we need to go to your DNS and add two records.
For this guide, I'll be assuming your DNS provider is GoDaddy, but it should be almost exactly the same for any DNS provider.

<Info>
  If you don't have a domain to use yet, then you can either buy one from a DNS
  provider like [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/) or just skip HTTPS for now.
</Info>

First, we need to grab the External IP address of the instance. You can get that from the VM Instance list page on GCP Console.

Finally, we need to head to the DNS provider and add two entries into the DNS:

![Instance](/images/setup_guides/gcp/ARecord.png)
![Instance](/images/setup_guides/gcp/CnameRecord.png)

The first record directs traffic to that domain to your GCP VM instance. The second record will handle
`www.<YOUR_DOMAIN>` and ensure that this also takes the user to your VM instance.

## Installing Dependencies

Next, we need to prepare the instance so we can actually get Onyx up and running. To do this, you'll
need three things: `git`, `docker`, and `docker compose`. For Debian Linux 12, this can be done with the following:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg

sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

If using CentOS, Red Hat Linux, or similar, you can use the following:

```bash
sudo yum update -y

sudo yum install docker -y
sudo service docker start

sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo yum install git
```

## Starting up Onyx

Now that we have everything we need we can startup Onyx.

First, let's clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx.git
```

Next, let's set the necessary env variables:

```bash
cd onyx/deployment/docker_compose
touch .env
touch .env.nginx
```

In the `.env` file, you can copy past the following (filling in the missing fields as needed):

```
WEB_DOMAIN=<YOUR_DOMAIN>  # something like "onyx.app"

# if your email is something like "chris@onyx.app", then this should be "onyx.app"
# this prevents people outside your company from creating an account
VALID_EMAIL_DOMAINS=<YOUR_COMPANIES_EMAIL_DOMAIN>

AUTH_TYPE=basic
# if you want to enable email verification, uncomment the following
# REQUIRE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=true
# SMTP_USER=<GMAIL_ACCOUNT_EMAIL_YOU_WANT_TO_SEND_VERIFICATION_EMAILS_WITH>
# SMTP_PASS=<GMAIL_ACCOUNT_PW_YOU_WANT_TO_SEND_VERIFICATION_EMAILS_WITH>

# if you've gone through the Google OAuth setup guide, then comment out
# the above and uncomment the following
# AUTH_TYPE=google_oauth
# GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=
# GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=
# SECRET=<RANDOMLY_GENERATED_UUID>

# Default values here are what Postgres uses by default, feel free to change.
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
```

In the `.env.nginx` file, put the following:

```
DOMAIN=<YOUR_DOMAIN>  # something like "onyx.app"
```

Next, let's get our SSL certificate from [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). To do this, we can simply run:

```bash
sudo ./init-letsencrypt.sh
```

<Info>
  If are skipping the HTTPS setup, you should start things up with: `sudo docker
  compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onyx-stack up -d --pull always`
  instead of the above. You can then access Onyx from the IP address from
  earlier or from the instance `External IP` provided on the instance's page in
  the GCP VM console.
</Info>

Voila, you're all done! 🎉

After waiting a few minutes (you can monitor the progress with
`sudo docker logs onyx-stack-api_server-1 -f`; once you see a log for
`INFO:     Application startup complete.` then everything should be good to go).
