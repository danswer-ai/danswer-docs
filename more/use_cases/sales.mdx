## Recall Every Detail

Being able to instantly revisit every detail of any call without reading transcripts is helping Sales teams provide more tailored pitches, build
stronger relationships, and close more deals. Instead of searching and reading through hours of transcripts in preparation for a call, your team can
now ask Onyx “What specific features was ACME interested in seeing for the demo”. Since your team doesn’t have time to read every transcript prior
to a call, Onyx provides a more thorough summary because it can instantly parse hundreds of pages and distill out the relevant information. Even
for fast lookups it becomes much more convenient - for example to brush up on connection building topics by asking “What rapport building topic did
we chat about in the last call with ACME”.

## Know Every Product Update

It is impossible for Sales teams to keep up with every product update. Because of this, when a prospect has a question that the Sales team does not
know, they have no choice but to rely on the Product and Engineering orgs to get an authoritative answer. Not only is this distracting to the other
teams, it also slows down the time to respond to the prospect (and as we know, time is the biggest killer of deals). With Onyx, it is even
possible to get answers live on call because of how fast accessing information becomes. A question like “Have we shipped the Microsoft AD integration
yet?” can now be answered in seconds meaning that prospects can get answers while on the call instead of asynchronously and sales cycles are reduced
as a result.
