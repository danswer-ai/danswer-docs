## What is Enterprise Search and why is it Important?

An Enterprise Search system gives team members a single place to access all of the disparate knowledge of an organization. Critical information is
saved across a host of channels like call transcripts with prospects, engineering design docs, IT runbooks, customer support email exchanges,
project management tickets, and more. As fast moving teams scale up, information gets spread out and more disorganized.

Since it quickly becomes infeasible to check across every source, decisions get made on incomplete information, employee satisfaction decreases, and
the most valuable members of your team are tied up with constant distractions as junior teammates are unable to unblock themselves. Onyx solves
this problem by letting anyone on the team access all of the knowledge across your organization in a permissioned and secure way. Users can ask
questions in natural language and get back answers and documents across all of the connected sources instantly.

## What’s the Real Cost?

A typical knowledge worker spends over 2 hours a week on search, but more than that, the cost of incomplete or incorrect information can be extremely
high. Customer support/success that isn’t able to find the reference to similar cases could cause hours or even days of delay leading to lower
customer satisfaction or in the worst case - churn. An account exec not realizing that a prospect had previously mentioned a specific need could lead
to lost deals. An engineer not realizing a similar feature had previously been built could result in weeks of wasted development time and tech debt
with duplicate implementation. With a lack of knowledge, your whole organization is navigating in the dark - inefficient and mistake prone.

## More than Search

When analyzing the entire corpus of knowledge within your company is as easy as asking a question in a search bar, your entire team can stay informed
and up to date. Onyx also makes it trivial to identify where knowledge is well documented and where it is lacking. Team members who are centers of
knowledge can begin to effectively document their expertise since it is no longer being thrown into a black hole. All of this allows the organization
to achieve higher efficiency and drive business outcomes.

With Generative AI, the entire user experience has evolved as well. For example, instead of just finding similar cases for your customer support team
to reference, Onyx breaks down the issue and explains it so that even the most junior members can understand it. This in turn lets them give the
most holistic and technically accurate response possible to your customers. On the other end, even the super stars of your sales team will not be
able to review 10 hours of transcripts before hopping on that critical call, but Onyx can easily parse through it in mere seconds and give crucial
context to help your team close.
