## AI Enabled Support

Customer support agents have one of the highest breadth jobs. They field requests that cover the entire surface area of the product and need to help
your users find success on extremely short timelines. Because theyâ€™re not the same people who designed or built the system, they often lack the depth
of understanding needed - resulting in delays and escalations to other teams. Modern teams are leveraging AI to help their CS team optimize the speed
and quality of these critical customer-facing interactions.


## The Importance of Context

There are two critical components of AI copilots for customer support. The first is that the AI system needs to be connected with as much information
as possible (not just support tools like Zendesk or Intercom) and that the knowledge needs to be as fresh as possible. Sometimes a fix might even be
in places rarely checked by CS such as pull requests in a code repository. The second critical component is the ability of the AI system to break
down difficult concepts and convoluted processes into more digestible descriptions and for your team members to be able to chat back and forth with
the system to build a better understanding.

Danswer takes care of both of these. The system connects up to over 30+ different applications and the knowledge is pulled in constantly so that the
information access is always up to date.
