## Beyond Answers

Agents enabled by generative AI and reasoning capable models are helping teams to automate their work. Onyx is helping teams make it happen.
Onyx provides out of the box user chat sessions, attaching custom tools, handling LLM reasoning, code execution, data analysis, referencing
internal knowledge, and much more.

Onyx as a platform is not a no-code agent builder. We are made by developers for developers and this gives your team the full flexibility and
power to create agents not constrained by blocks and simple logic paths.

## Flexibility and Extensibility

Onyx is open source and completely whitebox. This not only gives transparency to what happens within the system but also means that your team can
directly modify the source code to suit your unique needs.
