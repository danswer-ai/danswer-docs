## Force Deletion of Connectors

If you must delete a connector and related information before the process of waiting for the background jobs to run, you can run a `deletion` script using the instructions that follow.

<Warning>This is not default behavior. Use sparingly</Warning>

#### How to find a connector ID?

1. Navigate to the <strong>connectors</strong> page.

2. Click on the connector you want the ID of .

3. On the connector's page, the URL's final number will be the ID of the connector. For example, in this example, the connector's ID is 2. Here is also a more zoomed in photo of the URL bar.

#### Deleting Locally

1. Gather the ID of the connector you wish to delete.

2. Navigate to the base folder of your Onyx repository.

3. Run `python3 backend/scripts/force_delete_connector_by_id.py <CONNECTOR_ID>`

#### Deleting in Docker Compose

Follow these steps to manually and immediately delete a connector and its contents within a container:

1. Ensure your Docker containers are running- you can refer to the [quickstart guide](/quickstart):

   ```
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml -p onyx-stack up -d --build --force-recreate
   ```

2. Identify the `<CONTAINER_ID>` of your API server container. It should contain the string `onyx-api`. You can list all running containers with:

   ```
   docker ps -a
   ```

3. Gather the ID `<CONNECTOR_ID>` of the connector you wish to delete.

4. Run the deletion script inside the Docker container:

   ```
   docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> python scripts/force_delete_connector_by_id.py <CONNECTOR_ID>
   ```

   Replace `<CONTAINER_ID>` with your actual API container ID, and `<CONNECTOR_ID>` with the ID of the connector you want to delete.

   For example:

   ```
   docker exec -it 92492089ada1 python scripts/force_delete_connector_by_id.py 10
   ```

5. The script will execute inside the container, accessing the necessary resources and performing the deletion.

#### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter permission issues, you may need to run the docker-compose command with sudo:

  ```
  sudo docker-compose exec <CONTAINER_ID> python /app/scripts/force_delete_connector_by_id.py `CONNECTOR_ID`
  ```

- Ensure that your user has the necessary permissions to execute docker-compose commands.

- If the script is not found, verify the path to the script within your Docker container.
