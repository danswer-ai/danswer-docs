## Curator Example 1

### Scenario

You are a Curator for the marketing team and a basic member of the sales team:

You want to add a connector from the sales team's group to a document set that belongs to the marketing team's group:

### How to do it

1. First, the connector needs to be added to the marketing team's group: <br/>

There are multiple ways to accomplish this: <br/>
    a. You can have an admin promote you to Curator for the sales team's group. <br/>
    b. You can have an admin add the connector to the group. <br/>
    c. You can create a copy of the connector yourself. <br/>

2. Once the connector is added to the group, you can add it to the document set.

### Important Note:

    Giving connector access to multiple groups (options a and b) will prevent the connector from being editable by Curators that dont curate all the groups the connector is a part of.

    In this example, Curator 2 would lose edit control of the Shared Sales Materials Connector.

    If this is not what you want, you can create a new identical connector for the marketing team's group and add it to the document set:
