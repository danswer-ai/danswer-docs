## EE environment variables 

In additon to the extra features mentioned in the [overview page](/enterprise_edition/overview), you have access to additional configuraton options in the form of environment variables as an Entprprise Edition user.


### ENV_SEED_CONFIGURATION

This variable allows you to start your Danswer instance with pre-configured options that persist across restarts.

#### Configuration Options

`ENV_SEED_CONFIGURATION` accepts a JSON string with the following options:

- `llms`: List of LLM configurations (name, provider, api_key, api_base, api_version, custom_config, default_model_name, fast_default_model_name)
- `admin_user_emails`: List of email addresses for automatic admin role assignment
- `seeded_name`: Pre-set name for your Danswer instance
- `seeded_logo_path`: Path to your logo within the `assets` folder

#### Usage Example

```bash
export ENV_SEED_CONFIGURATION='{"admin_user_emails": ["email@gmail.com"], "seeded_name": "Acme Corp", "seeded_logo_path": "assets/logo.png"}'
```

This configuration sets up admin email, instance name, and logo path.

### API_KEY_HASH_ROUNDS

This variable allows you to configure the number of rounds used in the SHA-256 Crypt hashing algorithm for API keys.

- **Default value**: 535000
- **Allowed range**: 1000 to 999999999

#### Usage Example

```bash
export API_KEY_HASH_ROUNDS=600000
```

Increasing this value enhances security but may impact performance. The default value provides a good balance for most use cases.


## Additional API Endpoints



### Standard Answers

Endpoint: `POST /query/standard-answer`

This endpoint allows you to test the standard answers that would be returned for a given message and set of Slack bot categories.

#### Request Body

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `message` | `string` | The message to test against the standard answers. |
| `slack_bot_categories` | `list[string]` | The Slack bot categories to use when searching for standard answers. |

#### Response

The response will contain the standard answers that match the provided message and categories, or an empty list of standard answers if none are found.

```json
{
  "standard_answers": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "keyword": "wifi",
      "answer": "The wifi password is \"XYZ\"",
      "categories": [
        {
          "id": 0,
          "name": "General"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "error_msg": null
}
```

If no standard answers are found, the response will be:

```json
{
  "standard_answers": [],
  "error_msg": null
}
```

#### Example Usage

You can test the endpoint using a tool like cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/query/standard-answer' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
       "message": "wifi password",
       "slack_bot_categories": ["General"]
     }'
```

This will test the standard answers for the message "wifi password" and the Slack bot category "General."
