description: 'Customize the look of Danswer'

As part of the Enterprise Edition, we provide the ability to easily customize the look of Danswer. This comes in two forms:

1. Adding in your own custom application name / logo.
2. Customizing every color in the UI.

### Customizing the Application Name / Logo

To provide your own application name / logo, you can use the `Whitelabeling` tab in the admin panel. Here, we provide a way to input
a name of your choice, as well as an optional logo.

### Customizing Colors

We use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to theme Danswer. Every color used is one of 
defined in our [tailwind.config.js file](https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer/blob/main/web/tailwind-themes/tailwind.config.js).

To customize all these colors, you can:

1. Navigate to `web/tailwind-themes/custom`. 
2. Create a new folder with the name of your organization.
3. Create a `tailwind.config.js` file in this new folder.
4. Override any values in specified in the base `tailwind.config.js` file.

For example, if you wanted to make the blackground black, you could use:

```
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */

module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        "background": "#000000",
      },
    },
  },
};
```

**NOTE:** for these changes to apply, you will need to build Danswer from source. If testing locally, you will need to restart the 
NextJS application to apply the changes.
