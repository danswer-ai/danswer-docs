Permissions for what documents users can and cannot access in Onyx are determined by the access level set for each connector.

### Connector Access Types:

#### 1. Public

    - Any user can access the documents in the connector

#### 2. Private

    - All documents from connectors that are private are only accessible to users in the group(s) that the connector is attached to.

#### 3. Sync

    - When one a connector is created with syncing access enabled, the permissions are inhereted from the source.
    - This means that permissions for each document match the document permissions in the source.
        - For example, if a document is shared with a user on Google Drive, that user will be able to access that document in Onyx.
    - This matching is done based on the user's email.
    - The permissions of documents owned by sync connectors are not editable within Onyx.
    - Syncing is currently available for:
        - Google Drive
        - Confluence
        - Jira
        - Slack
