Permissions for what documents users can and cannot access in Danswer are determined by the access level set for each connector.

## Connector Access Levels:

### 1. Public
    - Any user can access the documents in the connector

### 2. Private
    - These are only accessible to users in the group that the connector is in.

### 3. Sync
    - When one a connector is created with syncing enabled, the permissions are inhereted from the source based.
    - This means that permissions for each document match the document permissions in the source.
    - The permissions of these connectors/documents are not editable within Danswer.
    - Syncing is available for:
        - Google Drive
