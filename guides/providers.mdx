## Danswer's Approach to LLM Providers

Danswer is designed to be model-agnostic, offering you the flexibility to choose the Language Model (LLM) that best suits your needs. This approach ensures that you're not locked into a single provider and can leverage the strengths of different models for various tasks.


## Model Overview

Danswer offers integration with several popular LLM providers, with a focus on models from OpenAI and Anthropic. Here's an overview of key models:

### OpenAI Models

#### GPT-3.5-Turbo
- **Strengths**: High speed, good quality for general tasks
- **Best for**: Quick queries, general information retrieval
- **Knowledge cutoff**: September 2021

#### GPT-4
- **Strengths**: High-quality responses, strong reasoning capabilities
- **Best for**: Complex analysis, creative tasks, code generation
- **Knowledge cutoff**: April 2023
- **Note**: Capable of image analysis

Here's the updated information on Anthropic models, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and a recommendation:

### Anthropic Models

#### Claude-3 Opus
- **Strengths**: Exceptional performance in reasoning and analysis tasks
- **Best for**: Complex problem-solving, detailed explanations
- **Note**: Offers high accuracy but may have slower response times

#### Claude-3 Sonnet
- **Strengths**: Balance of performance and speed
- **Best for**: General-purpose tasks requiring good quality and reasonable speed
- **Note**: Good all-around performer for most use cases

#### Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **Strengths**: Enhanced capabilities over Claude-3 Sonnet
- **Best for**: Advanced general-purpose tasks with improved performance
- **Note**: Recommended for most use cases due to its superior balance of capabilities

#### Claude-3 Haiku
- **Strengths**: Fast responses, efficient for simpler tasks
- **Best for**: Quick queries, real-time applications
- **Note**: Sacrifices some complexity for speed

For most use cases, Claude 3.5 Sonnet is recommended as it offers an excellent balance of advanced capabilities, performance, and speed, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.


## Custom Providers
Danswer allows you to add custom providers by integrating any model from the [LiteLLM providers list](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers). This flexibility enables you to use specialized or proprietary models that best fit your organization's needs.



## Choosing the Right Model

Consider these factors when selecting a model:

1. **Task Complexity**: More complex tasks benefit from advanced models like GPT-4 or Claude-3 Opus.
2. **Response Speed**: For quick responses, consider faster models like GPT-3.5-Turbo or Claude-3 Haiku.
3. **Cost Considerations**: More advanced models typically have higher usage costs.
4. **Data Privacy**: For strict data policies, consider open-source models like Llama 2 that can be self-hosted.
5. **Specific Strengths**: Some models excel in particular areas (e.g., coding, analysis, creativity).

We recommend testing different models with your typical queries to determine which performs best for your specific use cases.

## Leveraging Model Flexibility

1. **Experiment**: Try different models for the same task to compare results.
2. **Monitor Performance**: Track which models perform best for different types of queries.
3. **Stay Updated**: Regularly check for updates and new model releases.
4. **Custom Integration**: Explore the option of integrating specialized models from the LiteLLM providers list for unique use cases.
