## Understanding Different Prompt Types

Onyx uses two main types of prompts when configuring an assistant: the System Prompt and the Task Prompt ("Additional Instructions"). Understanding the difference between these is crucial for creating an effective assistant.

### System Prompt

The System Prompt sets the overall context and behavior of your assistant. It defines:

- The assistant's role
- General behavioral guidelines
- Any limitations or restrictions

The System Prompt is like giving your assistant its job description and what its purpose is.

Example System Prompt:

```
You are an HR assistant for Onyx Inc. You have access to the company's HR policies, benefits packages, and procedures. Maintain a professional and friendly tone in all interactions. If you're unsure about any information, advise the user to contact the HR department directly. Do not make up information or policies.
```

### Task Prompt

The Task Prompt provides specific instructions on how the assistant should handle and respond to user queries. It defines:

- Steps to follow for each query
- How to process and present information
- When to ask for clarification
- How to handle different types of requests

The Task Prompt is like giving your assistant a specific protocol for handling each interaction.

Example Task Prompt:

```
Follow these steps when responding to a user query:
1. Identify the main HR topic or policy in the user's question.
2. Search the provided HR documents for relevant information.
3. Summarize the applicable policy or procedure in clear, concise language.
4. If multiple policies apply, list them in order of relevance.
5. Provide the source document and section for your information.
6. If the query is unclear, ask the user for clarification before providing an answer.
7. If the query is outside your knowledge base, politely direct the user to contact the HR department.
```

## Testing and Refinement

After creating your assistant:

1. Conduct test runs with various queries
2. Gather feedback from a small group of users
3. Use Onyx's analytics tools to identify areas for improvement
4. Regularly update and refine your assistant based on feedback and changing needs

## Sharing and Permissions

- Determine the appropriate access level for the assistant (e.g., specific departments, entire organization)
- Utilize Onyx's group features to manage access efficiently
- Consider creating multiple versions of an assistant for different user groups if needed

By carefully configuring these elements, you can create a Onyx assistant that effectively serves your organization's needs, providing accurate and helpful responses to user queries.
