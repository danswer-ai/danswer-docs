## Setting up the Google Cloud App

Create a google project: https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate

## Enabling the People API

Enable the **Google People API** here: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/people.googleapis.com

Be sure to have the right project selected.

## Setting up the OAuth Consent Screen

Go to **APIs & Services** on the left hand tab (see image below).

Then select **OAuth Consent screen** page.

![GoogleOAuthConsentMenu](/images/google_oauth_setup/GoogleOAuthConsentMenu.png)

Under OAuth Consent screen select either Internal or External

- Companies with a **Google Workspace** should choose `Internal`
- Otherwise choose `External`

On the next page:

- Provide an app name (can go with `Onyx`)
- Provide any email you own (or founders@onyx.app if you want us to handle questions from your Onyx users)
- Upload the Onyx logo (or leave blank)
- The **Developer contact information** can be any email you own (or again, founders@onyx.app)

![GoogleApp](/images/google_oauth_setup/GoogleApp.png)

Leave the optional fields blank

Click **SAVE AND CONTINUE**

Leave the next two pages for **Scopes** and **Test users** blank.

## Setting up Credentials

Still under **APIs & Services**, go to **Credentials** on the left hand bar

Click on **+CREATE CREDENTIALS** and choose `OAuth client ID`

Select `Web application` then call it `Onyx`

Add a `Authorized JavaScript origins` as:

- `http://localhost:3000` for local or replace with `https://<WEB_DOMAIN>` (e.g. `https://www.onyx.app`) if setting up for prod.

Add a `Authorized redirect URIs` as:

- `http://localhost:3000/auth/oauth/callback` for local setup or `https://<WEB_DOMAIN>/auth/oauth/callback` if setting up for prod.

Click **CREATE** and save the Client ID and Client Secret for use in the next section

## Turning on OAuth in Onyx

OAuth is controlled by 3 environment variables, regardless of deployment choice
(non-containerized, docker compose, kubernetes). To turn the feature on set:

- `AUTH_TYPE=google_oauth`
- `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<your client id from above>`
- `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<your client secret from above>`
- If setting up in production, then:
  - `WEB_DOMAIN=<your domain including protocol e.g. https://www.onyx.app>`

### Non Containerized

Simply set the above environment variables when running the different Onyx processes.

- The backend api server uses the 3 environment variables
- The frontend hits the api server to determine what user authentication setting is configured and serves the relevant pages.

### Docker Compose

Simply set the 4 environment variables in a file called **.env** under **onyx/deployment/docker_compose**.

### Kubernetes

Kubernetes deployment was designed for production use and assumes that user Auth is a required feature therefore it is
on by default. To set up the required values, replace the `REPLACE-THIS` values in secrets.yaml with thebase64 encoded
client ID and client secret from above.
